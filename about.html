        <h2>Words from our CEO</h2>
        <br>
      <p>I was born in the second generation since my sisters, where I get the privilege of receiving a better lifestyle than what my siblings and parents had gone through. However, I later realized in my youth that my privileges are born from the hardwork of my parents. They are, however, not the exception to receive energy through means of blood, sweat and tears. Reading about SDG 7's goal, I wanted to change the norm of society and help others who are too poor to receive a better form of energy. I believe in my philosophy, that runs this company all together: Clean energy should be a choice, not a privilege</p>
